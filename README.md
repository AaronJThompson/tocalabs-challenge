# Tocalabs Interview Challenge

## Description
This is my submission for the Tocalabs interview challenge.  
The aim of the challenge is to create an RDP-like server and remote-client, sending screen capture and receiving mouse and keyboard events.
The server and remote-client are split into two seperate programs, with the remote-client written in C# using .Net, and the server written in Node.JS using express with websockets.
